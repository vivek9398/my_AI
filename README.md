# AI Role Selector

A web application that lets users interact with AI personas for different professional roles. This application can work with OpenAI's API for real AI responses or use a fallback mode for demonstration purposes.

## Features

- Multiple professional role options (Developer, Designer, Data Scientist, etc.)
- Interactive chat interface
- Role-specific AI responses
- Integration with OpenAI API
- Fallback mode when no API key is provided
- Mobile-responsive design
- Works with GitHub Pages

## How to Use

### Option 1: With OpenAI API (Full AI Experience)

1. Clone this repository
2. Get an API key from [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/)
3. Enter your API key in the settings panel of the application
4. Select a professional role and start chatting with the AI

### Option 2: Without API Key (Demo Mode)

1. Clone this repository
2. Leave the API key field empty
3. The application will use the built-in fallback response generator
4. Select a professional role and start chatting

### Deploying to GitHub Pages

1. Enable GitHub Pages in your repository settings (Settings > Pages)
2. Select the branch you want to deploy (usually `main` or `master`)
3. Your site will be published at `https://[your-username].github.io/[repository-name]/`

## Customization

### Adding New Roles

To add new professional roles, edit the `roles.js` file and add a new object to the `roles` array following this structure:

```javascript
{
    id: 'uniqueId',
    name: 'Role Name',
    icon: 'fa-icon-name',  // Font Awesome icon class
    description: 'Brief description of the role',
    greeting: "Initial greeting message from the AI",
    knowledge: [
        "Knowledge area 1",
        "Knowledge area 2",
        // Add more knowledge areas
    ]
}
```

### Improving Fallback Responses

To improve the fallback responses (used when no API key is provided):

1. Edit the `fallback.js` file
2. Add more conditional responses for different roles
3. Enhance the response generation logic

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (Vanilla)
- OpenAI API integration
- Font Awesome for icons

## Security Note

This application stores your OpenAI API key in your browser's localStorage. While convenient, be aware that:

1. The API key is only stored on your local device
2. Clear your browser data if using on a shared computer
3. For production applications, consider using a backend proxy to handle API calls

## Disclaimer

When using the fallback mode (no API key), responses are simulated and not generated by an actual AI model. For the full AI experience, an OpenAI API key is required.
